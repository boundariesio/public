boundaries.io is an API for retrieving GeoJSON for common US geographic topologies.
Data is mostly comprised of US Census TIGER dataâ€”yielding up-to-date information on the
census-defined geographies converted from Shapefile format.

You can query the boundaries.io API for free to retrieve GeoJSON documents with the
same meta properties as the original shapefiles.

## Looking to use the API?

[The hosted API is currently out of service](https://github.com/jbielick/boundaries.io/issues/10). If you'd like private or public access, [please consider sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/jbielick).
