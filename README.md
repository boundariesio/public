boundaries.io is an API for retrieving GeoJSON for common US geographic topologies.
Data is mostly comprised of US Census TIGER dataâ€”yielding up-to-date information on the
census-defined geographies converted from Shapefile format.

You can query the boundaries.io API to retrieve GeoJSON documents with the
same meta properties as the original shapefiles.
